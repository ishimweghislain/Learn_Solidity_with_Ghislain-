## ðŸ’¸ Sending ETH Through Functions

To send ETH with a transaction, your function must be marked `payable`. This allows the function to receive `msg.value`, the amount of ETH (in wei) sent with the transaction.

### âœ… Example:
```solidity
function fund() public payable {
    require(msg.value > 0, "You need to send ETH");
}
