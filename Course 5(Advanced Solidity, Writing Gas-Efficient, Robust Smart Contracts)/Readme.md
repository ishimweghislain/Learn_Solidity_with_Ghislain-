## âœ… What Youâ€™ll Learn

### ðŸ”¹ Immutable & Constant
- Difference between `immutable` and `constant` variables
- When to use each to save gas and improve security

### ðŸ”¹ ETH Gas Prices
- Understanding how gas pricing works in Ethereum
- Real-time gas tracking tools
- Why **you shouldnâ€™t stress about gas optimizations early on**

### ðŸ”¹ Naming Conventions
- Professional naming standards in Solidity
- How to write clean, readable, and maintainable contracts

### ðŸ”¹ Custom Errors
- Introduction to custom errors in Solidity
- Gas-saving benefits vs using `require("message")`
- Syntax and examples of defining and using custom errors

```solidity
error Unauthorized();
require(msg.sender == owner, Unauthorized());
