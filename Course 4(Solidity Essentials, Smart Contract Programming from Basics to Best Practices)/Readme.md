# Solidity Essentials: Smart Contract Programming from Basics to Best Practices

Welcome to the **Solidity Essentials** course! This beginner-friendly guide takes you through key concepts in smart contract development using Solidity — from basic syntax to industry-standard best practices like overflow protection and proper ETH handling.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

### 🔹 Basic Solidity Concepts
- `msg.sender` and how contracts interact with external accounts
- `this` keyword in Solidity
- Constructors and initialization of contracts
- Double equals (`==`) usage in comparisons

### 🔹 Arrays & Structs
- Declaring and using arrays
- Working with custom structs
- Resetting arrays in Solidity

### 🔹 For Loops and Logic
- Creating and iterating with `for` loops
- Using `/* */` for multi-line comments

### 🔹 Modifiers
- Writing and applying custom `modifier`s
- Role of `require()` and access control

### 🔹 ETH Transfer Techniques
- Sending Ether from smart contracts using:
  - `transfer`
  - `send`
  - `call`

### 🔹 Working with Libraries
- Creating and using Solidity libraries
- Importing external libraries from GitHub
- Using `SafeMath` for overflow protection
- Difference between `checked` and `unchecked` arithmetic blocks

### 🔹 Interfaces & Imports
- Declaring interfaces in Solidity
- Importing and interacting with other contracts via GitHub URLs
