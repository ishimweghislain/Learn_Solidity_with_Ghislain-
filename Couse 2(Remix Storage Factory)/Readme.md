# ðŸ”— Solidity Advanced Concepts: Importing, Interacting, and Inheritance

This document summarizes key advanced Solidity concepts I studied: contract composability, interacting with other contracts, and inheritance with overrides.

## ðŸ“¦ Importing Contracts into Other Contracts

### âœ… Composability in Solidity
Solidity supports **modular development**. You can break your project into reusable, composable contracts and import them into one another.

### ðŸ“¥ How to Import a Contract

```solidity
import "./AnotherContract.sol";
